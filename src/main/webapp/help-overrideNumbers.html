<div>
	If a number is specified here, it will override the number tracked from build to build and the next build
	will use this number instead.  If left blank, it will increment the number from the previous build if necessary,
	and use that.  If no previous build used the Version Number Plugin, then this defaults to 1.  Negative numbers
	are not allowed.
